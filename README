BEGIN DEAD PROJECT ALERT

I have stopped developing this project, and have taken down the website.
Mostly it was due to lack of motivation after I found out that other sites
already do the same, and better. The repository is still here for historical
purposes

END DEAD PROJECT ALERT


Does this book have a sequel? or a prequel? is it part of a greater story arc?
What's the name of the other books in the story arc, and in what order do they
appear? What about translations?

I call the science behind this question "quelology", and that is what this
project is about: gather semantic relations between books (and later maybe
other media) from various sources, and make that information easily available
and editable.

Technologies used:
    * HTML, CSS, Javascript
    * Perl 5.12 with
        + Mojolicious
        + DBIx::Class
    * PostgreSQL

Wanted: 
    * Designers
    * Programmers
    * Testers (once it works a bit better)
    * Users that enter data about books they read
    * Users

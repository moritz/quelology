always just a shortcut, so there was a way to do anything without drag-drop, eg. if there would be a cut button next to each node, and after you've cut any number of nodes, a paste button where you have the 
[ambrus] blue plusses currently, plus a way to undo cutting.
It's a bit hard for me to drag nodes to long distance.

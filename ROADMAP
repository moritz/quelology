The following features are planned for Quelology:


1) Initial feature phase:
TODO:
    * explaining texts
    * search in the database
    * authentication, signup
    * more advanced tree edit (?)
    * imprint
    * unit tests
DONE:
    * edit titles etc.

(go live in read-only mode)

2) Big Redesign phase:
    * consistent design
    * easier tree editing

(go live for real)

3) More Feature phase:
    * CSRF protection
    * cross-browser testing
    * use, created and view aliases
    * timeline view
    * translations
    * i18n, l10n
    * on-site SEO (titles, URLs)
    * other data source /link destination than amazon
    * non-book media
    * log changes to make them reversible
    * more advanced edit:
        - guard against multiple edit fields at once
            (which would mean that a user input might be lost)

4) Even More Features phase (speculative at best):
    * "social" features (?)
    * badges/achievement for editing (?)
    * voting on correctness, content; maybe user karma (?)
